# rock-paper-scissors

12/5/22 This is my first java script project. I'll be creating a rock paper and scissors game. This version will just be the logic behind the game and will be played in the console. I'll add a GUI at a later date.

12/7/22 Revisited the rock paper scissiors project from before. Added user interface.
